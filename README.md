The attenuation of neurogenesis in the mouse SGZ has been reported to result in the impairment of new memory formation. These new neurons are also important for the formation of spatial memories. Furthermore, new integrated neurons in the DG have the function of organizing past memories and alleviating the stress response

Study entropy production and the arrow of time. Treating each variable independently leads to overestimate. Time revesibility?


# Goals

1. modelling human memory through neurogenesis and apoptosis in deep self organizing recurrent networks
2. Alleviate catastrophic forgetting phenomena in continuos learning
3. Distributed representation of patterns and memory retrieval: catastrophic interference
4. Investigate inductive biases and multi-task learning 

# TODO
1. Why we need neurogenesis in SORN?

    a. Network size vs Number of active synapses vs Network performance in sequence learning
    
    b. Investigate and identify document how and why catastrophic forgetting occuring.
    
    b. Observe dynamic memory and adaptation strategies. https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25858-z
    
2. Add new neurons at random time intervals and repeat step 1.
3.
